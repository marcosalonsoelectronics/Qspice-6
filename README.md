Simulation files of video Qspice #6: Current-Mode Push-Pull Converter using the UC1846

Available at: https://youtu.be/FUtxXZ31Ffg

This video explains the operation and features of the controller UC1846 and its use in the control of a current-mode push-pull converter. A Qspice simulation is presented to verify the operation of the converter in open loop. Also valid for the UC2846 and the UC3846.
